  #* line_number      - the line number analyzed (provided)

  #* initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number
  #* calculate_word_frequency() - calculates result

  #* take in a line of text and line number
  #* initialize the content and line_number attributes

  #* calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() - determines the highest_count_across_lines and 
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines attribute values
  #* print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the values of LineAnalyzer objects in 
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines in the specified format
